    <!--math.random(),console.log(),JSON and localStorage etc are built-in objects.Here we gonna focus on JSON and localStorage.-->
    <!--JSON:It stands for Javascript Object Notation.It's a similar syntax to a javascript object,but it has less features.One difference is all properties and strings must use double quotes.JSON does not support single quotes.We use JSON because js object makes sense only in js however JSON syntax  can be understood by almost every programming language.-->
    <!--We use JSON:
    -when we send data between computers.
    -when we store data.-->
    <!--The JSON objects helps us convert a js object to JSON.-->

    <!--localStorage:Used to save values permanently-->
